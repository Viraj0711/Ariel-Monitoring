# Icon Setup Instructions

## To complete the ConstructEye icon setup:

1. Save your Building.png image to this public folder (`public/Building.png`)
2. The HTML file has already been updated to reference `/Building.png` as the favicon
3. The tab title has been changed to "ConstructEye"

## Current Setup:
- ✅ Tab title updated to "ConstructEye"
- ✅ Meta descriptions updated
- ✅ Favicon link added to HTML
- ⏳ Building.png needs to be placed in public folder

## File location needed:
`public/Building.png` - Your construction building icon image

The browser will automatically pick up the new icon once the file is placed in the correct location.
